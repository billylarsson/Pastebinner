Pastebin-API tool for reading, posting, deleting, comes with GPG-support.
If you really want to use this you'll figure out how this works, else contact me. (only tested with Linux, I have no idea what happens if try this on clown platforms)



install packages from terminal: pip install pyqt6 pillow gnupg
